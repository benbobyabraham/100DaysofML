# Projects
Completing projects is as important as learning new concepts. Here is a list of projects along with links to their repositories. 
You can contribute your project to the list by filling out [this](https://forms.gle/WDteyBcF3RHaX87A9) form and get featured as a Contributor to 100 Days of ML community. While contributing, do make sure that the code has enough comments/instructions for a beginner to start with.  

**Please Note**: We Do Not recommend you to copy these projects but to understand and make some of yours.  

### List of Projects
1.  **[Stock Markets Analysis and Forecasting](https://github.com/kashish45/StockMarketForecasting)**, *Kashish*  
  The project explains everything about Stock Market and Forecasting of Markets using all possible techniques which include Machine Learning and Time Series Analysis.

2.  **[Top and Bottom News hashtags](https://github.com/arpit282/Word2vec)**, *Arpit Singh*  
 The project uses the 2020 NEWS summary, heading, keywords and hashtags to get the most frequently used words by combining all the mentioned above columns. Word2vec converts the columns into 100 vectors dimensions. PCA converts them into 2 dimension for plotting relation between the words.

3.  **[Drowsiness Detector and Face Landmark Detection](https://github.com/charansoneji/Drowsiness-detector-and-Face-Landmark-detection)**, *Charan Lalchand Soneji*  
 The project uses Dlib and OpenCV to help us identify the essential landmarks of our face such as eyebrows, eyes , jawline etc. Dlib's pre-trained models and helps us with the identification of these features.

4.  **[Background replacement using OpenCV](https://github.com/charansoneji/Background-removal-and-replacer-using-OpenCV)**, *Charan Lalchand Soneji*   
 Background Removal is used very commonly in most video streaming services such as Zoom, Hangouts etc. So we have our background and we have our foreground. This project is gonna help us remove our background and replace it with any video or picture. BACKGROUND SUBTRACTION technique is used to achieve this.  
  
5. **[Face Verification using One-Shot Learning](https://github.com/Octaves0911/Face_verification)**,*Aman Kumar Mallik*  
  Face verification is the task of comparing a candidate face to another and verifying whether it is a match. Technique of One-Shot Learning has been used which learns information about object categories from one, or only a few, training samples/images. The base model is an inception network.
